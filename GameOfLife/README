This is the code for the Game Of Life Kata we performed at Qualogy on 8/12/2011

The object of the kata was to implement a (text based) game of life 
(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) with which a player 
could (programmatically) seed a game of life and have it play any given number of 
generations.

The code in the master / root branch is the state of the code where we ended up
at the end of the common kata. 

My (wouter) continuation with that code is in the 'wouter' branch. Feel free to 
fork from the master, and send us a line on where to find your own version. 
Either from scratch, or continuing where we ended tonight.
